# Combinator libraries for indentation-sensitive parsing (compatability library)

This is a compatability library for users of earlier versions of `indentation` that exports both of the backends below.

New projects should use:
* [`indentation-parsec`](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/indentation-parsec) for [Parsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/parsec)
* [`indentation-trifecta`](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/indentation-trifecta) for [Trifecta](https://hackage.haskell.org/packages/trifecta)
